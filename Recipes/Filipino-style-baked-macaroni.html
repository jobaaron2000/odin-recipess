    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot over medium heat, bring about 4 quarts salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and cook 1 to 2 minutes less than package's directions. Rinse under cold running water and drain well.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>For the Meat Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add sliced hotdogs and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 1 to 2 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add onions and garlic and cook until softened.</li>
        <li>Add bell peppers and cook until tender-crisp.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef and cook, stirring occasionally and breaking apart with the back of a spoon, for about 7 to 10 minutes until lightly browned. Drain any excess fat.
        </li>
        <li>Add tomato sauce, tomato paste, ketchup, and beef broth.</li>
        <li>Stir in sugar and Italian seasoning.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil. Lower heat, cover and continue to cook for about one hour or until meat is fully cooked and sauce is thickened.
        </li>
        <li>During the last 10 minutes of cooking, add browned hotdogs. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>For the Cheese Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a skillet over medium heat, melt butter.</li>
        <li>Add flour and stir well into a smooth paste. Cook, stirring regularly, for about 5 to 7 minutes or until golden (but NOT browned) and starts to bubble a bit.
        </li>
        <li>Gradually add milk to the roux, whisking vigorously to prevent lumps. Cook, whisking regularly, for about 2 to 3 minutes or until smooth and thick enough to coat the back of the spoon.</li>
        <li>Stir in nutmeg and salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Gradually add quick-melt and cheddar cheese, whisking regularly until melted. Cook until cheese sauce is thick but spreadable.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>To Assemble</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Grease bottom and sides of a 9 x 13 baking dish with nonstick cooking spray and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine macaroni and meat sauce. Gently toss together until well-combined.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pasta mixture to the prepared dish. Spoon cheese sauce on top, spreading across to cover the pasta completely.</li>
        <li>Bake in a 375 oven for about 20 to 25 minutes or until hot and bubbly. Remove from oven and allow to cool for about 15 minutes before cutting into serving portions.</li>
